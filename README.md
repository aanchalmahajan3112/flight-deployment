**Flight Price Prediction**

In this project, the aim is to predict the price of flight using machine learning techniques. By analyzing a vast amount of historical flight data, a model is developed which is capable of accurately forecasting ticket prices. Prices are predicted based on various factors such as source, destination, arrival, departure, stoppage, and specific travel dates and airlines that influence airfare fluctuations. 
Used different regression algorithms but the one which had the highest accuracy was CatBoostRegressor with accuracy of 82%.
Also deployed this model on cloud platforms using Flask.
The goal is to provide travelers with valuable insights,so they can make informed decisions and plan their trips more efficiently. Through data-driven predictions, the aim is to strive to revolutionize the way people book flights, optimizing their travel experience.
